Nevertheless, unavoidable leakage in the production, distribution, storage and consumption of H2 could drastically alter the mixing ratio of H2 in the atmosphere. Although it is not a greenhouse gas itself, H2 affects the atmospheric lifetime of the greenhouse gas methane and many other species via its reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical (Schultz et al.,2003). In addition, H2 is an important source for stratospheric water vapor, which provides the substrate for polar stratospheric clouds that play a key role in the formation of the stratospheric polar ozone hole. Therefore, increasing levels of H2 in the atmosphere will counteract the predicted recovery of the ozone hole (Tromp et al., 2003; Warwick et al.,2004; Feck et al., 2008).","broader":"d8dcfd36-f71c-499f-84f5-43da9fee26c5","uuid":"e073c9d4-5a61-436c-8890-2695c4e825eb"}],"label":"HYDROGEN COMPOUNDS","definition":"Hydrogen (H) is the lightest and most abundant chemical element.

It is sufficiently cold for noctilucent ('night shining') clouds to form in summer, at altitudes around 83 km.   Noctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.  They are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees.   Noctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.  One hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.  Subsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.  Noctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.  Competing anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.  They have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature &/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes."}],"uuid":"04bc6942-12e0-413f-94d2-1ba7f5edf595"},{"label":"STRATOSPHERIC CLOUDS (OBSERVED/ANALYZED)","children":[{"uuid":"9d3d400c-ded2-4b3c-8d0c-5a76e25be033","broader":"d6ab88c0-5a97-4f5e-8e4c-1c6fc6ed368f","definition":"Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play a central role in the formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic and Arctic. PSCs provide surfaces upon which heterogeneous chemical reactions take place. These reactions lead to the production of free radicals of chlorine in the stratosphere which directly destroy ozone molecules.  PSCs form poleward of about 60ÂºS latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.  Type II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83ÂºC).  The Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8ÂºC above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.  Despite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude. The measurements are being used to investigate the climatology of the clouds and their relation to the temperature structure of the stratosphere, and the influence of atmospheric gravity waves and planetary waves in modulating their structure and ozone depletion.","label":"POLAR STRATOSPHERIC CLOUDS/NACREOUS"}],"broader":"162e2243-3266-4999-b352-d8a1a9dc82ac","uuid":"d6ab88c0-5a97-4f5e-8e4c-1c6fc6ed368f"},{"uuid":"705cd3a0-ea07-40c8-bfa1-9c26f22d13ba","broader":"162e2243-3266-4999-b352-d8a1a9dc82ac","children":[{"definition":"A principal cloud type, forming in the high levels of the troposphere, composed of ice crystals which appear from the ground as a transparent sheet or veil, often creating a halo phenomenon around the sun or moon.

No matter what the nature of the vapor source (warm water, industrial combustion exhaust, exhaled breath), its equilibrium vapor pressure is greater than that corresponding to the colder air; thus, the water vapor, upon becoming mixed with and cooled by the cold air, rapidly condenses. It should be noted that this mechanism never allows the fog to actually reach the vapor source. Also, upon further mixing in sufficiently turbulent or convective flow (only a slight degree is needed), the fog particles evaporate at a more or less well defined upper limit of the fog. Note, also, that although advection of air is necessary to produce steam fog, it differs greatly from an advection fog in the usual sense, which is caused by warm, moist air moving over a cold surface. Steam fog is commonly observed over lakes and streams on cold autumn mornings as well as in polar regions. It is sometimes confused with ice fog, but its particles are entirely liquid.

Coalescence between colliding drops is affected by the impact energy, which tends to increase with the higher fall velocities of larger drops. Colliding drops having negligible impact energy compared to their surface energy behave as water spheres that collide with a collision efficiency (the fraction of small drops that collide with a large drop within the geometric collision cross section) predicted by the theory for falling spheres. The result of increasing impact energy is to flatten the colliding drops at the point of impact, impeding the drainage of the air and delaying contact between them. As the distortion relaxes, the drops rebound, reducing the coalescence efficiency for cloud drops and drizzle drops colliding with smaller drops. At larger impact energy, separation will occur if the rotational energy (fixed by conservation of angular momentum) is higher than the surface energy of the coalescing drops. This phenomenon, termed temporary coalescence, can result in satellite droplets considerably smaller than either of the parent drops. This phenomenon is also called partial coalescence because the large drop may gain mass as a result of the higher internal pressure in the small drop. At still larger impact energy, drop breakup occurs for the smaller drop. About 20% of the high-energy collisions between large raindrops (d > 3 mm) and drizzle drops (d > 0.2 mm) result in the disintegration of both drops. Other factors that affect coalescence are electric charge and electric field, both of which promote coalescence, leading to earlier onset of coalescence during an interaction so that coalescence efficiencies are increased by suppression of rebound and temporary coalescence. All of these processes are important in formation of precipitation in all liquid clouds both above and below 0Â°C.","broader":"63effad4-4323-486d-a81b-e0bf3264e5c9","label":"COALESCENCE","uuid":"d5d64790-db29-451d-b022-a461dac06228"}],"label":"DROPLET GROWTH"},{"uuid":"76bcb8e0-1c07-4783-9d15-3a22203f7849","label":"COLLISION RATE","broader":"0cfcbaa7-727b-4199-8cca-93824b427e9b","definition":"Rate of droplet collisions."},{"label":"PARTICLE SIZE DISTRIBUTION","broader":"0cfcbaa7-727b-4199-8cca-93824b427e9b","definition":"The frequency distribution of drop sizes (diameters, volumes) that is characteristic of a given cloud or of a given fall of rain.

Microfossils are a heterogeneous bunch of fossil remains studied as a single discipline because rock samples must be processed in certain ways to remove them and microscopes must be used to study them. Thus, microfossils, unlike other kinds of fossils, are not grouped according to their relationships to one another, but only because of their generally small size and methods of study. For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology.   Microfossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain. Paleoenvironmental analysis is the interpretation of the depositional environment in which the rock unit formed, based upon the fossils found within the unit. There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.","broader":"44d0ad8f-fe22-4d17-bc47-c0b728a82baf","label":"MICROFOSSIL"},{"label":"PETROLEUM VERTICAL/GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION","definition":"The vertical and geographic distribution of petroleum within the solid Earth.","broader":"44d0ad8f-fe22-4d17-bc47-c0b728a82baf","uuid":"f9e3595d-29b6-462a-8eb6-a06e5a02b081"}],"definition":"Petroleum is a naturally occurring flammable liquid consisting of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights and other liquid organic compounds, that are found in geologic formations beneath the Earth's surface.

Other than a few exceptions, minerals containing phosphorus are in the maximally oxidized state as inorganic phosphate rocks.","broader":"1459a39c-4781-4481-8bd9-510762865efd","label":"PHOSPHOROUS","uuid":"846d2db9-41cd-4ae8-b4ff-a34a9efb7428"},{"definition":"Nitrogen compounds refer to the nitrogen particles that come from industrial manufacturing which cause contamination to water resources.","broader":"1459a39c-4781-4481-8bd9-510762865efd","label":"NITROGEN COMPOUNDS","uuid":"644e0f53-98a2-4512-a228-00f5e61fd93d"},{"broader":"1459a39c-4781-4481-8bd9-510762865efd","definition":"Organic compounds composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen atoms.","label":"HYDROCARBONS","uuid":"0ba2ccb3-332c-4ee6-a9c9-50dce5a6c0cc"},{"definition":"Dissolved or particulate substances that are not hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon derivatives.","broader":"1459a39c-4781-4481-8bd9-510762865efd","label":"INORGANIC MATTER","uuid":"9bdac7db-be34-4eed-91bc-28f6628ed044"},{"label":"ORGANIC MATTER","broader":"1459a39c-4781-4481-8bd9-510762865efd","definition":"Soil constituents consisting of a wide range of organic (carbonaceous) substances, including living organisms, carbonaceous remains of organisms which once occupied the soil, and organic compounds produced by current and past metabolism in the soil.","uuid":"ee92daf8-d0da-4476-b389-0485114cbbe9"},{"uuid":"bf03dba8-2881-44ac-abfc-ba3353f67a24","definition":"Nonmetallic element of Group 15 of the periodic table.

Many of the countries most affected by ENSO events are  developing countries with economies that are largely dependent upon  their agricultural and fishery sectors as a major source of food  supply, employment, and foreign exchange. New capabilities to predict  the onset of ENSO event can have a global impact. While ENSO is a  natural part of the Earth's climate, whether its intensity or  frequency may change as a result of global warming is an important  concern.

The oscillation of surface and upper-level winds was remarkably clear  in Singapore. Until the early 1980's little attention was paid to this  oscillation, which became known as the Madden and Julian  Oscillation(MJO), and some scientists questioned its global  significance. Since the 1982-83 El Nino event, low-frequency  variations in the tropics, both on intra-annual (less than a year) and  inter-annual (more than a year) timescales, have received much more  attention, and the number of MJO-related publications grew rapidly.

The reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a countryâs development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience. With this information to hand, the outcome for countries could be optimised for their unique situations and development goals.","broader":"23703b6b-ee15-4512-b5b2-f441547e2edf","children":[{"broader":"897b3d65-709c-4739-9ba6-85911295d843","label":"FIJI INDEX","uuid":"47200796-7541-4659-acf4-32b5303bcc1f"},{"broader":"897b3d65-709c-4739-9ba6-85911295d843","label":"TUVALU INDEX","uuid":"585182e9-6e5b-4ad6-96fe-065ffd31f7e8"},{"uuid":"2c1e046e-2feb-4cb7-a6dd-f3753db7b5f5","broader":"897b3d65-709c-4739-9ba6-85911295d843","label":"SAMOA INDEX"}],"label":"ENVIRONMENTAL VULNERABILITY INDEX (EVI)"},{"uuid":"112e71ec-c0a1-49a8-82d7-bcb317b45860","broader":"23703b6b-ee15-4512-b5b2-f441547e2edf","label":"LAND SURFACE/AGRICULTURE INDICATORS","children":[{"label":"SATELLITE SOIL MOISTURE INDEX","definition":"The Satellite Soil Moisture Index combines AVHRR-measured NDVI with  surface temperature to compute an estimate of plant moisture stress,  then scales it to produce an index image.

It uses a 0 as normal, and drought is shown in terms of minus numbers; for example, minus 2 is moderate drought, minus 3 is severe drought, and minus 4 is extreme drought. The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculating short-term abnormal dryness or wetness affecting agriculture. CMI is designed to indicate normal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season; it uses the same levels as the Palmer Drought Index.

When the ice-caps melt during periods of warm climate the proportion of 18O decreases. There are two ways of obtaining data about the 16O to 18O ratio, both using measurements made using a mass spectrometer. The first is to use cores from the polar ice-caps which preserve layers of snow ultimately made from sea water. The second is to use the skeletons of foraminifera preserved in ocean-bottom ooze because these marine fossils had the same 16O to 18O ratio as the sea water during the time they were alive.

The feedback of the undisturbed process is comparably weak, however, because the local release leads to a warming spread over the whole globe.  The Arctic region is one of the many natural sources of the greenhouse gas methane.[1] Global warming may accelerate its release, due to both release of methane from existing stores, and from methanogenesis in rotting biomass.[2] Large quantities of methane are stored in the Arctic in natural gas deposits, permafrost, and as submarine clathrates. Permafrost and clathrates degrade on warming, thus large releases of methane from these sources may arise as a result of global warming.[3][4] Other sources of methane include submarine taliks, river transport, ice complex retreat, submarine permafrost and decaying gas hydrate deposits.[5]"},{"definition":"A theory of global tectonics in which the lithosphere is divided into a number of plates whose pattern of horizontal movement is that of torsionally rigid bodies that interact with one another at their boundaries, causing seismic and tectonic activity along these boundaries.","broader":"c9a5b3eb-7556-41a8-a2b8-c015db80e5b2","label":"PLATE TECTONICS","uuid":"6971fecc-af14-4c97-82db-2b01c98453b9"},{"uuid":"1cbefa2a-484e-4742-ad3d-d347d27272bd","label":"SPELEOTHEMS","broader":"c9a5b3eb-7556-41a8-a2b8-c015db80e5b2","definition":"a structure formed in a cave by the deposition of minerals from water, e.g. a stalactite or stalagmite."},{"uuid":"08bc1b7d-b27b-43e2-a728-4939efb88f08","label":"VOLCANIC ACTIVITY","definition":"a vent in the crust of the earth or another planet or a moon from which usually molten or hot rock and steam issue; also : a hill or mountain composed wholly or in part of the ejected material","broader":"c9a5b3eb-7556-41a8-a2b8-c015db80e5b2"},{"label":"ICE CORE RECORDS","children":[{"label":"CARBON DIOXIDE","broader":"08a4f002-f368-414d-b923-83dd498452d8","definition":"A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide traps infrared radiation.

Some recent models include the biosphere, carbon cycle and atmospheric chemistry as well. AOGCMs can be used for the prediction and rate of change of future climate. They are also used to study the variability and physical processes of the coupled climate system. Global climate models typically have a resolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate projections from the Hadley Centre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its successor HadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have usually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but if a carbon cycle model is included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon dioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Similarly, an AOGCM coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is able to predict the changes in concentration of other atmospheric constituents in response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases. Further information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3 (thermohaline circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability in the ocean of HadCM3.  Recently a global coupled climate model with an eddy-permitting ocean resolution has been developed at the Hadley Centre, in order to better represent important oceanic processes.
