It usually occurs in combination  with plant sugars.

HCN is produced by other plants,  bacteria and fungi. Emissions from CN radicals are occasionally observed from  lightning disturbed air. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by biomass burning since  nitrogen in plant material is mostly present as amino acids and upon combustion this nitrogen is emitted as a variety of compounds including NH3, NO, NO2, N2O, organic nitriles and nitrates. It is interesting to note that the atmospheric  measurements of HCN reported by Zander et al. (1988) gave a mixing ratio for  HCN in the Southern Hemisphere which was approximately 5% higher than that for  the Northern Hemisphere. This may be due to biomass burning.  There are many anthropogenic sources of compounds containing CN which can be  released into the atmosphere.

It is sufficiently cold for noctilucent ('night shining') clouds to form in summer, at altitudes around 83 km.   Noctilucent clouds can only be seen when the sun is shining on them (at ~83 km) and not on the lower atmosphere, i.e. when the sun is between 6 and 16 degrees below the horizon.  They are a summer, polar phenomena but because of the restrictive viewing conditions they are most commonly observed at latitudes between 55 and 65 degrees.   Noctilucent clouds were first reported in 1885 when they were independently observed in Germany and Russia. This was two years after the volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in the Straits of Java.  One hypothesis is that the initial observation of noctilucent clouds was related to an increase in the number of observers of the twilight skies attracted by the spectacular displays resulting from the globally distributed volcanic debris of Krakatoa. Alternatively, water vapour injected into the upper atmosphere by the volcano ultimately reached the cold, dry upper mesophere.  Subsequent observations have proved that noctilucent clouds are not solely related to volcanic activity, and their volcanic association is now scientifically contentious. It has been alternatively claimed that the appearance of noctilucent clouds is the earliest evidence of anthropogenic climate change.  Noctilucent cloud observations from north-west Europe over the last 30 years show an increasing trend in the number of nights on which the clouds are observed each summer season, superimposed on a decadal variability that appears to be solar-cycle related.  Competing anthropogenic explanations for this increasing occurrence of noctilucent clouds focus on either excessive greenhouse cooling of the middle atmosphere or increased water vapour linked to increased methane release associated principally with intensive farming activities.  They have been observed thousands of times in the northern hemisphere, but less than 100 observations have been reported from the southern hemisphere. It has not been resolved if this is due to inter-hemispheric differences (temperature &/or water vapour) in the atmosphere at these altitudes, or the lack of observers and poorer observing conditions in southern latitudes."}],"broader":"162e2243-3266-4999-b352-d8a1a9dc82ac","label":"MESOSPHERIC CLOUDS (OBSERVED/ANALYZED)"},{"children":[{"label":"POLAR STRATOSPHERIC CLOUDS/NACREOUS","definition":"Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) play a central role in the formation of the ozone hole in the Antarctic and Arctic.

PSCs form poleward of about 60ÂºS latitude in the altitude range 10 km to 25 km during the winter and early spring. The clouds are classified into Types I and II according to their particle size and formation temperature.  Type II clouds, also known as nacreous or mother-of-pearl clouds, are composed of ice crystals and form when temperatures are below the ice frost point (typically below -83ÂºC).  The Type I PSCs are optically much thinner than the Type II clouds, and have a formation threshold temperature 5 to 8ÂºC above the frost point. These clouds consist mainly of hydrated droplets of nitric acid and sulphuric acid.  Despite two decades of research, the climatology of PSCs is not well described, and this impacts on the accuracy of ozone depletion models. The timing and duration of PSC events, their geographic extent and vertical distributions, and their annual variability are not well understood.The Davis lidar has been used to study stratospheric clouds since 2001. The observations consist of profiles of Rayeligh laser backscatter at a wavelength of 532 nm as a function of altitude.

No matter what the nature of the vapor source (warm water, industrial combustion exhaust, exhaled breath), its equilibrium vapor pressure is greater than that corresponding to the colder air; thus, the water vapor, upon becoming mixed with and cooled by the cold air, rapidly condenses. It should be noted that this mechanism never allows the fog to actually reach the vapor source. Also, upon further mixing in sufficiently turbulent or convective flow (only a slight degree is needed), the fog particles evaporate at a more or less well defined upper limit of the fog. Note, also, that although advection of air is necessary to produce steam fog, it differs greatly from an advection fog in the usual sense, which is caused by warm, moist air moving over a cold surface. Steam fog is commonly observed over lakes and streams on cold autumn mornings as well as in polar regions. It is sometimes confused with ice fog, but its particles are entirely liquid.

The process of clumping together of snow crystals following collision as they fall to form snowflakes.  This process is especially important near the melting layer where snow particles stick to each other more easily because of the liquid water on the surface.

Coalescence between colliding drops is affected by the impact energy, which tends to increase with the higher fall velocities of larger drops. Colliding drops having negligible impact energy compared to their surface energy behave as water spheres that collide with a collision efficiency (the fraction of small drops that collide with a large drop within the geometric collision cross section) predicted by the theory for falling spheres. The result of increasing impact energy is to flatten the colliding drops at the point of impact, impeding the drainage of the air and delaying contact between them. As the distortion relaxes, the drops rebound, reducing the coalescence efficiency for cloud drops and drizzle drops colliding with smaller drops. At larger impact energy, separation will occur if the rotational energy (fixed by conservation of angular momentum) is higher than the surface energy of the coalescing drops. This phenomenon, termed temporary coalescence, can result in satellite droplets considerably smaller than either of the parent drops. This phenomenon is also called partial coalescence because the large drop may gain mass as a result of the higher internal pressure in the small drop. At still larger impact energy, drop breakup occurs for the smaller drop. About 20% of the high-energy collisions between large raindrops (d > 3 mm) and drizzle drops (d > 0.2 mm) result in the disintegration of both drops. Other factors that affect coalescence are electric charge and electric field, both of which promote coalescence, leading to earlier onset of coalescence during an interaction so that coalescence efficiencies are increased by suppression of rebound and temporary coalescence. All of these processes are important in formation of precipitation in all liquid clouds both above and below 0Â°C.","uuid":"d5d64790-db29-451d-b022-a461dac06228","broader":"63effad4-4323-486d-a81b-e0bf3264e5c9"}],"broader":"0cfcbaa7-727b-4199-8cca-93824b427e9b","label":"DROPLET GROWTH"},{"uuid":"76bcb8e0-1c07-4783-9d15-3a22203f7849","broader":"0cfcbaa7-727b-4199-8cca-93824b427e9b","label":"COLLISION RATE"},{"definition":"The frequency distribution of drop sizes (diameters, volumes) that is characteristic of a given cloud or of a given fall of rain.

For many purposes a useful single parameter representing a given distribution is the volume median diameter, that is, that diameter for which the total volume of all drops having greater diameters is just equal to the total volume of all drops having smaller diameters.

Wildfire suppression also addresses the issues of the wildland-urban interface, where populated areas border with wildland areas.","label":"WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION","broader":"868b87a1-d8c2-49b3-8bbd-9cbbed115271","uuid":"5e693789-87a8-4f94-9b5d-a50cecf55e24"},{"uuid":"436b098d-e4d9-4fbd-9ede-05675e111eee","broader":"868b87a1-d8c2-49b3-8bbd-9cbbed115271","definition":"Characterized by deposits of charcoal and ash, removal of vegetation, and alteration of the vegetation structure, Pereira et al. 1997, Roy et al. 1999","label":"BURNED AREA"}],"broader":"ec0e2762-f57a-4fdc-b395-c8d7d5590d18"},{"uuid":"b3406120-9faa-4c00-874e-ce8878ae129f","broader":"ec0e2762-f57a-4fdc-b395-c8d7d5590d18","definition":"Sudden, violent movement of the Earth's crust.","label":"EARTHQUAKES"},{"broader":"ec0e2762-f57a-4fdc-b395-c8d7d5590d18","uuid":"06c1281f-e306-4511-bdab-ed6c0694f0f9","definition":"Explosions or emissions of lava, ashes and toxic gases from deep inside the earth, through volcanoes.","label":"VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS"},{"broader":"ec0e2762-f57a-4fdc-b395-c8d7d5590d18","uuid":"f81d3752-d97c-4caf-9a79-5709ee693158","label":"LANDSLIDES","definition":"A slide of a large mass of dirt and rock down a mountain or cliff."},{"label":"LAND SUBSIDENCE","definition":"Occurs when large amounts of ground water have been withdrawn from certain types of rocks, such as fine-grained sediments.

For example, fossils of bacteria, foraminifera, diatoms, very small invertebrate shells or skeletons, pollen, and tiny bones and teeth of large vertebrates, among others, can be called microfossils. But it is an unnatural grouping. Nevertheless, this utilitarian subdivision of paleontology, first recognized in 1883, is very significant in geology, paleontology, and biology.   Microfossils have many applications to petroleum geology (Fleisher and Lane, in press, Ventress, 1991, LeRoy, 1977). The two most common uses are: biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental analyses. Biostratigraphy is the differentiation of rock units based upon the fossils which they contain.

There are many other uses of fossils besides these, including: paleoclimatology, biogeography, and thermal maturation.","label":"MICROFOSSIL"},{"broader":"44d0ad8f-fe22-4d17-bc47-c0b728a82baf","uuid":"f9e3595d-29b6-462a-8eb6-a06e5a02b081","label":"PETROLEUM VERTICAL/GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION","definition":"The vertical and geographic distribution of petroleum within the solid Earth."}],"broader":"e3fa1998-b003-4d55-a92e-16b42ac0fc17","definition":"Petroleum is a naturally occurring flammable liquid consisting of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons of various molecular weights and other liquid organic compounds, that are found in geologic formations beneath the Earth's surface.

These regions capture the largest precipitation anomalies associated with the interannual variations of the Walker circulation and contain the largest correlations between GPCP and Nino 3.4 and SOI. Within P and MC the absolute magnitude of the largest correlation is over +0.6.   Because of the spatially varying nature of rainfall, it was decided to use a moving block average which would capture the strongest zonal gradients within the equatorial Pacific. This procedure is unlike many fixed area average indices, and allows for a realistic meridional component of the precipitation gradient and migration of the ascending and descending branches of the Walker circulation.

Since precipitation is not normally distributed, a  transformation is first applied so that the transformed precipitation  values follow a normal distribution.  The Standardized Precipitation Index was designed to explicitly  express the fact that it is possible to simultaneously experience wet  conditions on one or more time scales, and dry conditions at other  time scales, often a difficult concept to convey in simple terms to  decision-makers.

This index is designed to be used with economic and social vulnerability indices to provide insights into the processes that can negatively influence the sustainable development of countries.  The reason for using indices for this purpose is to provide a rapid and standardised method for characterising vulnerability in an overall sense, and identifying issues that may need to be addressed within each of the three pillars of sustainability, namely environmental, economic and social aspects of a countryâs development. Development is often achieved through trade-offs between these pillars. Therefore, in order to promote sustainability, it has become increasingly important to be able to measure how vulnerable each aspect is to damage and to identify ways of building resilience.

The Crop Moisture Index (CMI) is also a formula that was developed by Wayne Palmer subsequent to his development of the Palmer Drought Index. The CMI responds more rapidly than the Palmer Index and can change considerably from week to week, so it is more effective in calculating short-term abnormal dryness or wetness affecting agriculture. CMI is designed to indicate normal conditions at the beginning and end of the growing season; it uses the same levels as the Palmer Drought Index.

They are also used to study the variability and physical processes of the coupled climate system. Global climate models typically have a resolution of a few hundred kilometres. Climate projections from the Hadley Centre make use of the HadCM2 AOGCM, developed in 1994, and its successor HadCM3 AOGCM, developed in 1998. Greenhouse-gas experiments with AOGCMs have usually been driven by specifying atmospheric concentrations of the gases, but if a carbon cycle model is included, the AOGCM can predict changes in carbon dioxide concentration, given the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Similarly, an AOGCM coupled to an atmospheric chemistry model is able to predict the changes in concentration of other atmospheric constituents in response to climate change and to the changing emissions of various gases. Further information is available on: some aspects of ocean simulation in HadCM3 (thermohaline circulation, ventilation, vertical mixing), decadal variability in the ocean of HadCM3.
